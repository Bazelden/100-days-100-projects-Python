# Here I will be learning the concept of loops in python # 

# For loop in python #
# A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). #

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)

# While loop in python #
# With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true. #

i = 1
while i <= 6:
    print(i)
    i += 1
